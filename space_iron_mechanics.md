# Space Iron Game Mechanics

Space Iron is a massively multiplayer online strategy game that fuses the best mechanics from classic tick-based resource MMOs. Players compete for dominance in a persistent universe through resource management, empire building, alliance warfare, and strategic planning. Below is a comprehensive overview of the planned core game mechanics.

---

## 1. Universe Structure
- **Planets & Colonies:** Each player starts with a home planet and can colonize additional planets and moons, up to a set limit.
- **Galaxies & Star Systems:** The universe is divided into galaxies and star systems, each with many planets, moons, and outposts.
- **Guilds & Kingdoms:** Players are grouped into guilds (alliances) and can form federations for large-scale cooperation.
- **Persistent Universe:** The game world is always active, with periodic rounds (seasons) and special events.

## 2. Resources & Economy
- **Primary Resources:** Metal, Crystal, Deuterium, and Credits, produced by mines, refineries, and trade.
- **Secondary Resources:** Food, Energy, and Runes, used for advanced construction, research, and special actions.
- **Resource Production:** Resources are generated each tick (hour), with production boosted by upgrades, buildings, and special events.
- **Trade & Market:** Players can trade resources on a dynamic market or via direct deals with others.

## 3. Construction & Technology
- **Buildings:** Mines, research labs, shipyards, defense platforms, farms, and special structures can be constructed and upgraded.
- **Research:** Unlocks new ships, buildings, spells, and technologies. Research is performed in labs and takes multiple ticks to complete.
- **Science & Magic:** Players can invest in science for economic/military bonuses or magic for unique spells and effects.

## 4. Fleets, Armies & Combat
- **Ship Types:** Multiple ship classes (fighters, bombers, transports, capital ships, probes, etc.) with unique stats and roles.
- **Ground Armies:** Planets can train ground units for planetary defense and invasions.
- **Fleet Construction:** Ships and armies are built using resources and time.
- **Combat:** Players send fleets to attack, raid, defend, or support. Combat is resolved automatically at the target tick, factoring in fleet composition, tech, and tactics.
- **Targeting & Tactics:** Players can set fleet tactics (focus fire, retreat, ambush, etc.) and target specific enemy classes.

## 5. Defense & Espionage
- **Defensive Structures:** Missile launchers, lasers, shields, bunkers, and planetary shields protect planets and moons.
- **Espionage:** Probes and spies gather intel on enemy planets, fleets, and defenses. Counter-espionage tech reduces enemy success.
- **Sabotage & Covert Ops:** Special missions allow sabotage, theft, or disruption of enemy operations.

## 6. Alliances, Diplomacy & Cooperation
- **Guilds/Alliances:** Players can form or join alliances for coordinated attacks, defense, and strategy.
- **Federations:** Multiple alliances can form federations for universe-scale wars and diplomacy.
- **Kingdoms:** Sub-groups within alliances for specialized roles (e.g., science, war, trade).
- **Shared Resources:** Alliances can pool resources for mega-projects or defense.
- **Diplomacy:** Formal treaties, non-aggression pacts, and trade agreements are supported.

## 7. Magic, Science & Special Abilities
- **Magic System:** Runes and energy can be used to cast spells for offense, defense, or support (e.g., shields, storms, sabotage).
- **Science System:** Invest in research for economic, military, or espionage bonuses.
- **Unique Abilities:** Races and personalities grant unique passive and active abilities.

## 8. Missions, Events & Progression
- **Mission Types:** Attack, raid, colonize, transport, defend, harvest, scan, sabotage, and more.
- **Events:** Random universe events (meteor showers, wormholes, galactic wars) and scheduled speed rounds.
- **Quests & Achievements:** Players and alliances can complete quests for rewards and recognition.
- **Seasons/Rounds:** The universe is played in seasons, with scores tallied and rewards given at the end. Special "Havoc" periods allow for chaotic play before reset.

## 9. Victory, Scoring & Rankings
- **Score:** Players and alliances earn points for resource control, combat, quests, and achievements.
- **Leaderboards:** Track top players, alliances, and federations.
- **Victory Conditions:** Multiple win conditions (domination, economic, scientific, etc.) for varied playstyles.
